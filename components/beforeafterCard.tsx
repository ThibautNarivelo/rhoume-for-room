        The deposit is non-refundable. A minimum 50€ deposit is required in
        advance to book a tattoo appointment.
        <br />
        A deposit is required for each tattoo, even if you are coming to get
        them on the same day. The deposit is payable via Bank Transfer.
        <br />
        Once a deposit has been received, we'll discuss and agree an appointment
        date and time.
        <br />
        Please book your tattoo appointment on a day where you have no set plans
        after your appointment.
        <br />
        Give yourself plenty of time and do not rush the artist.
        <br />
        If you would like to rearrange your appointment it is asked for a
        minimum of 10 days notice.
        <br />
        Failing to notify me within the minimum 10 days notice will result in
        losing your deposit.
        <br />
        The deposit is non-refundable if for whatever reason.
        <br />
        Please do not come to your tattoo appointment if you are feeling unwell.
        <br />
        Just give me as much notice as you can, at least 2 hours before your
        appointment.
        <br />
        Bear in mind that you may still be contagious even if you feel you’ve
        recovered from symptoms.
        <br />
        If you’ve been suffering from a cold, flu, a cough, temperature, or a
        sickness bug for example and have started to feel better, please don't
        come in.
        <br />
        I’m a small business, and work illness has a big impact on my business -
        so please don’t come in unless you’re sure you are no longer contagious.
        <br />
        If you cancel because you are ill or recovering from illness, I will
        give you a period of time (usually 30 days) in which you must reschedule
        your appointment.
        <br />
        Your deposit will be carried over to the new appointment.
        <br />
        If you are ill a second time and give less than 10 days notice prior to
        your second appointment, the deposit will then become non-refundable.
        <br />
        If you are more than 20 mins late for your appointment, the time missed
        will be charged at my hourly rate and will be in addition to the cost of
        your tattoo once you arrive.
        <br />
        I reserve the right not to tattoo you if you arrive leaving insufficient
        time for me to complete the tattoo. Custom drawings/tattoo designs are
        not available until the day of your appointment.
        <br />
        We ask customers to look through my tattoo portfolio and reviews (healed
        and fresh tattoos available on Instagram and on my website) before
        booking.
        <br />
        There is always time on the day to discuss your design and ask for small
        changes. There is always time on the day to discuss your design and ask
        for small changes. There is always time on the day to discuss your
